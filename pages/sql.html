DBMS: Database Management system is collection of programs that
enables user to store, retrieve, update and delete info/data from database
RDBMS: Relational Database Management System is based on relational model. Data
from relational databases can be accessed or reassembled in many different
ways without having to recongnize the database tables. Data from relational 
database can be accessed using API, or SQL
SQL: Structured Query Language is language designed specifically to communicate
with databases. SQL is an ANSI standard.
SQL statements are of three types:
  DDL Data Definition Language
    that holds the data. CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE TABLE
  DML Data Manipulation Language
    used to manipulate data itself. INSERT DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT
  DCL Data Control Language
    used to control visibility of data like granting database access
    and set privileges to create tables. GRANT, REVOKE, ACCESS permissions

  Advantages of SQL: 
    Sql is not proprietary language: used by specific database vendors. Almost
    every major DBMS supports SQL, so learning this one language will enable
    programmers to interact with any database like ORACLE, SQL ,MYSQL etc
    SQL is easy to learn: English like words
    SQL is powerful: you can perform complex and sophisticated database operations
    like nested queries etc
Field:  A field is an area within a record reserved for a specific piece of data
  exmaple Employee Name, Employee ID, etc
Record: A collection of values/fields of specific entity i.e. an Employee,
Salary etc
Table: A table is collection of records of specific type. Example employee table,
salary table, 

Transaction:
  Database transaction takes database from one consistent state to another. At the
  end of the transaction the system must be in the prior state if the transaction
  fails or the status of the system should reflect the successful completion if the
  transaction goes through
  Properties:
    Atomicity: A transaction consists of many steps. When all the steps in a 
    transaction get completed, it will get reflected in Db or if any step fails,
    all transactions are rolled back
    Consistency: Database will move form one consistent state to another,if the
    transaction succeeds and remain in original state, if the transaciton fails
    Isolation: Every transaction should operate as if it is the only transaction
    in the system.
    Durability: Once transaction has completed successfully, the updated rows/
    records must be available for all other transactions on a permanent basis

  Database Locks:
    Shared Lock: Other transaction can only read the item but can't write into it
    Exclusive Lock: other transactions can't read or write into data item

  Database Normalization:
    The process of removing the redundant data, by splitting up the splitting
    up the table in a well defined fashion is called normalization.
    1NF: First normal form if and only if all underlying domains contain
    atomic values only. After 1NF we can still have redundant data.
    2NF: Second normal form if and only if it is 1NF and evey non key attribute
    is fully dependent on the primary key. After 2NF we can still have redundant
    data.
    3NF: Third normal form if and only if it is 2NF and evey non key attribute 
    is non transitively dependent on the primary key
