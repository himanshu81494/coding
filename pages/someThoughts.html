<code class="language-cpp">
 char a[] = "string";
 char *p = "string";

 if(a[3] == p[3])
  cout&lt&lta[2]&lt&lt"-"&lt&ltp[2];
 else cout&lt&lt"WHAT";

 This will print out:
    ring-ring

Why?
It looks like something below in dataStructure representation
in memory
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+----+
  a: | s | t | r | i | n | g | \0 |
     +---+---+---+---+---+---+----+
     +-----+     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 
  p: |  *======&gt | s | t | r | i | n | g |\0 |    
     +-----+     +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+ 

a is the name assigned to the block of memory allocated when declaration: char a[] = "string"
but p has to take another route. p is pointer to a 
memory location that is having first element of anoymous
memory block assigned to it when executing line:
char *p = "string";
or
char *p; p = "someString";
